    This project is an educational platform which consists of a web app and a mobile app. Both consume data from the <a href="https://codetheory-api.onrender.com/swagger/index.html">API</a>, which provides data about lessons, quizzes and platform users.

## ðŸ“Œ About The Project  

Learning algorithms and object-oriented programming can be challenging for many students because traditional teaching materials often provide only theory, but lack real-life examples which illustrate how these concepts are applied in practice. This is why **CodeTheory** offers a structured and interactive learning platform. The platform provides lessons filled with photos, videos, diagrams, animations and code examples in C#, C++, Java, and Python. After each lesson there is a quiz which reinforces students' understanding through practice and repetition.

The platform includes algorithm animations that allow students to observe how sorting and searching algorithms work step by step. From simple ones such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort to more advanced ones like Merge Sort and Quick Sort, the platform also includes searching algorithms such as Linear Search and Binary Search. The platform also covers the core principles of OOP like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

The system is built around three main components:  
- **API** â€“ The backend that manages lessons, quizzes, authentication, and user progress
- **Web Application** â€“ A browser-based client that consumes the API and delivers student lesson and quizzes, provides teachers a valuable tool for tracking student progress and helps administrators manage all users of the platform
- **Mobile Application** â€“ An Android client that also consumes the API and allows students to learn on the go

Role-based access system is implemented in the project with three distinct user types. **Students** are the primary users who engage with lessons, complete quizzes, and track their progress over time,  **teachers** monitor the progress of their students, while **administrators** manage all user accounts. 
The web app supports all three user roles, the mobile app is focused exclusively on the student role to provide a streamlined learning experience on the go.
